# PrikolsHub RoControl

skid admin to connect roblox and discord

This works on a `SessionPool` basis, meaning, that multiple sessions can be in a single channel, and message history is present, because channels are not deleted and the audit log isn't spammed.

## Future updates TODO:

- [ ] Bring back the beloved **`/action`** and **`/session`** from legacy PrikolsHub RoControl
- [ ] **`/hub execute`** command to access the script hub
- [ ] Image uploading & conversion via **`/image upload`**
- [ ] `SessionPool` graphical editor via **`/owner pools`**
- [ ] User script uploading via **`/hub upload`**
